# Movie Genres

The program consist of two parts. The first part was developed using java. It processes a CSV file that contain details of movies such as genre, title and release year in order to answer three major questions which are : how many movies associated with each genre?, what is the average number of movies associated with each genre? And how many movies were released each year? . The second part of the project was developed using python that process the results of the first part in order to provide a representation of these results which will help us identify the pattern of film industry growth along the century.

## Installation

The files that should be compiled are located in Src folder. After you set your working directory to Src folder Compile the file using the command **javac filename.java** then run the program using the command **java filename**. The results are located in output folder that is nested in Data folder. In order to compile the second file you need to install matplotlib library which can be done using the command **sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib**. Once the library is installed compile the file using the command **python -m py_compile filename.py**. Run the second file using the command **python filename.py**. The representation of the data should be located in the output file too.
